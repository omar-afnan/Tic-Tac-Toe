Tic Tac Toe 🎮
Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game – a super simple, fun way to relive those classic school days when we used to draw grids on paper and battle it out for three in a row!

What’s This About? 🤔
It’s Tic Tac Toe! You know the drill:

You and a buddy take turns placing X's and O's on a 3x3 grid.
First one to line up three in a row wins (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
If all the spaces are filled and no one wins, it’s a tie. (Friendship stays intact. 😅)
Why Did I Make This? 🛠️
Honestly, I just wanted to build something fun and quick while brushing up on coding. Plus, who doesn’t love a little friendly competition? Whether you're here to play or just check it out, I hope it brings a smile to your face.

How Do You Play? 🎲
Start the game (instructions depend on how you’re running it).
Player 1 is X, Player 2 is O.
Take turns choosing your spots until someone wins or it’s a tie.
Celebrate your victory… or hit "restart" and try again. 😏
What’s Next? 🚀
I might add:

A single-player mode where you can battle an AI (or, you know, curse at your computer when it wins 🤖).
Fancy animations to make it pop.
An online mode to take on your friends (or random strangers) across the internet.
Thanks for Stopping By! 💜
If you play and enjoy this, awesome! If you have feedback, ideas, or just want to say hi, hit me up. Let’s keep the games going!
